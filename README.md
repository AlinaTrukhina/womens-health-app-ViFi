### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (For local use / demoing)

## Installation

### Local Use

1. Create a database named `womens_health_app` in PostgreSQL,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

### Deployed Domain

1. Create a database named `womens_health_app` in a PostgreSQL-based database
2. Import the queries in the `database.sql` file to your database (i.e. bit.io)
3. Create a .env file in the root folder and set a SERVER_SESSION_SECRET variable.
4. Set NODE_MAILER_USER and NODE_MAILER_USER_KEY variables.
5. If deploying to Heroku, set a DATABASE_URL variable in heroku config.
6. Deploy the webapp. The recommended domain is [heroku](www.heroku.com). 
7. Follow deploying steps given by the website including connections to your database
8. Go to the given URL of your domain!
