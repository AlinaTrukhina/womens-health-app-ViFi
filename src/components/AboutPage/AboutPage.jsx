        <p>
          Laina Latterner is an accomplished strategic sales and marketing consultant
          with over 15 years of experience in the global medical device industry with
          organizations including Roche Diagnostics and McKesson.</p>

        <p>Her critical thinking
          and innovative ideas combined with her deep knowledge of laboratory testing,
          women’s health, and healthcare reform, enable her to identify unique opportunities
          in the marketplace for her clients.</p>

        <p>Throughout her career she focused on clinician education and saw a gap
          between the information healthcare providers knew and the amount of time they
          had to share it with their patients. The ViFi is her solution to this problem.
          She is passionate about working towards health equity and improving women’s
          health outcomes and experiences in the healthcare system.. She also loves a
          good DIY project, wine and spending time with her family.
